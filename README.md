#  Live Photo Cleaner

## Features
- You can preview the memory that will be regained before cleaning up the photos
- The still pictures remain linked with the albums they were added to.
- Live Photos which were offloaded to iCloud are downloaded automatically.
- The app is ad-free and will remain free forever because we care!

## Good to know
- LivePhotoCleaner duplicates the Live Photo as a still picture, and moves the original to the "Recently Deleted" folder of the iOS Photos App. Thus memory will only be reclaimed after the photo is deleted for good.
- The still pictures will appear as new pictures in the "Recents" album of the iOS Photos App. There is currently, no way around this, unfortunately.
- Live Photos you edited (applied a bounce, loop, or long-exposure effect, applied a color filter, corrected exposure, cropped, etc.) cannot be cleaned up at the moment.
